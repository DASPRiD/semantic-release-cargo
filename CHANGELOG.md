# [2.0.0](https://github.com/semantic-release-cargo/semantic-release-cargo/compare/v1.0.2...v2.0.0) (2022-12-19)


This is **not** a breaking change from semantic-release-rust@1.0.0-alpha.8, or from semantic-release-cargo@1.

This is only a feature update, I mistakenly bumped major versions on the beta branch and decided not to rewrite published history to avoid v2.0.0.

### Features

* feat: wrap rust code in npm package using napi-rs ([cedc828](https://github.com/semantic-release-cargo/semantic-release-cargo/commit/cedc828fbe8f2e889febbe02e248de11e7a459e9))
* support installation with cargo binstall

### Fixes

* use clap@v4 for argument parsing instead of structopt

### BREAKING CHANGES

* Use napi-rs to call the Rust library from Node.js.

This deletes the Rust binary. Moving forward, **semantic-release-cargo**
should be installed by npm.
